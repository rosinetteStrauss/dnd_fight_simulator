I want an application able to work even without internet connexion

Goal of the application:
	take inputs for a set of players and foes (neutral npcs is nth).
	then run the fight between the two groups several time and output stats about chances of winning

		- file (at least 1) containing the foes stats
		- file (0 or more - nth) containing the npcs stats
	- Output :
